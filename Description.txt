JustAnotherPassword is a lightweight and privacy-focused Chrome extension that generates secure, readable passwords using client-side cryptography + base64 encoding.

🔐 How it works:
- Random bytes are securely generated using the browser’s cryptography API
- These bytes are converted into a hex string
- The hex string is then base64-encoded using a custom, shuffled alphabet
- Output is readable, copyable, and strong

✅ Works completely offline  
✅ Uses a custom scroll wheel interface to select password length  
✅ No tracking, no servers, no saved data  
✅ Clean, minimalist interface — just generate and go
